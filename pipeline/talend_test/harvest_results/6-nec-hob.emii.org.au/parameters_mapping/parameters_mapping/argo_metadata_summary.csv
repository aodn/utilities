"# IMOS IODE,2,Probably good data,Good data in which some features (probably real) are present but these are unconfirmed. Code 2 data are also data in which minor malfunctions may be present but these errors are small and/or can be successfully corrected without seriously affecting the overall quality of the data. "

Where data values must be changed (e.g. smoothing of data sets) we strongly prefer that the original data be retained and an additional variable be added to accommodate the interpolated/corrected data values."
