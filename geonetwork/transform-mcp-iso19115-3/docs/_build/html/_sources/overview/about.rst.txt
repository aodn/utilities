This document contains the  mapping of Marine Community Profile v 2.0 (MCP 2.0) metadata elements and
codelists to core ISO 19115-1 metadata elements and codelists by the AODN Metadata Mapping Working Group.

The document focuses on mappings to ISO 19115-1:2014/AMD 1:2018 but in general the mapping to ISO19115-1:2004 is
the same, and where it isn't the differences are noted.

Examples of how this mapping is expressed in xml as implemented using ISO 19139 and ISO 19115-3 are included in this
document.
